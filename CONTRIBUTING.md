We welcome contributions from the community. If you have a unique rice that you'd like to showcase, please follow these guidelines:

# Share your Rice

1. **Prepare your rice repository:** Make sure that the `README.md` of your rice repository includes a screenshot. This allows users to quickly see how your rice looks.

2. **Create a Pull Request (PR):** Add an entry of your rice under the correct WM/DE section in our `README.md` in the format:

    ```markdown
    - [Your GitHub Username](https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepositoryname)
    ```
    ##### Entries should be sorted alphabetically to maintain order and ease of navigation for users

# Optional
